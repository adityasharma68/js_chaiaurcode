    <h3>What is API</h3>
    <p>API stands for Application Programming Interface, In JavaScript, an API is like a set of tools that allows you to interact with different parts of the browser or other services. It's a way for your code to talk to and use functionalities provided by the browser or external services without having to write all the complex code yourself.</p>

    <h3>What is xhrRequest</h3>
    <p>XMLHttpRequest (XHR) objects are used to interact with servers. You can retrieve data from a URL without having to do a full page refresh. This enables a Web page to update just part of a page without disrupting what the user is doing.</p>
    <p>XMLHttpRequest is used heavily in AJAX Programming.</p>  
    
    <h3>Property of XMLHttpRequest</h3>
    <p>0 UNSENT Client has been created. open() not called yet.</p>

      available.
    </p>
